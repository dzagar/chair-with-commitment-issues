# chair-with-commitment-issues
Built by Dana Zagar, Sarah Whelan and Tyler Lacroix (March 2017). 

Modelled for a smart chair, to gently remind the person sitting to stand up at set intervals. While they are sitting, the chair monitors posture. Posture was modelled using a potentiometer and the person's weight was modelled with a temperature sensor. 

Built using Assembly language on the HC12 microcontroller for the ECE 2275 (Microcontrollers) design project.
